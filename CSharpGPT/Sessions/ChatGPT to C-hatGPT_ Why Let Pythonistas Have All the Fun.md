# ChatGPT to C#hatGPT: Why Let Pythonistas Have All the Fun?
## 15:30 - 16:30 | Speaker: Andr치s Velv치rt
Feeling left out of the AI buzz because you 're a C# developer? Don't fret; this session is your golden ticket.

This example- and code-rich talk will introduce you to the powerful GPT models running on Azure and show you how to harness their power using C# within your application or web service. You will also be introduced to Function Calling so that the AI can interact with the real world through your application. Just be careful not to give it too much power!
