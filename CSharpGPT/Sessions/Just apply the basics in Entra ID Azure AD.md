With Microsoft's focus on Defender for * and Entra ID Premium P2 features, you might start to believe that you can't be successful in your identity and zero trust journeys when you don't have these products and licenses. The opposite is true: without doing the basics, all these advanced products don't perform as well as you'd think...

Come to this session to learn the basics and then apply 'em to your Entra ID (Azure AD)!
